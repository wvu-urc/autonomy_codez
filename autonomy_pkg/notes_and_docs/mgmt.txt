will recieve a list of gps points
need to parse them and make an internal list


need to recieve a list of points, update internal points

once parsed, publish out first point
if planner_reached_goal, send next point

while planner is executing:

    if it is an aurco or yolo and it recieves gps points from aruco or yolo, send that as the goal gps, and skip search points

    also check if a signal has been recieved to go to the last point, and go to it 




parsing:

labels:

    gps

        just add gps to list

    aruco

        generate search points

    yolo

        generate search points


        

for now:

recieve list of points, parse and generate search 

publish new goal
if recieved sucess, repeat
